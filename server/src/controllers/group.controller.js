/*1. Add a "Groups" collection to your MongoDB database to store group information such as group name, group description, group members, and group posts.
2. Create a form on your app where users can create a new group by providing a group name, group description, and selecting a category or interest that the group will be based on.
3. When a user creates a new group, add the group information to the "Groups" collection in MongoDB and make the creator of the group the first member.
4. Allow users to search for and join existing groups by browsing categories or interests, or by searching for a specific group name or keyword.
5. When a user requests to join a group, add their user ID to the "group members" field in the corresponding group document in MongoDB.
6. Implement a way for users to post in a group by creating a form where they can write a post and submit it to the corresponding group.
7. When a user posts in a group, add the post information to the "group posts" field in the corresponding group document in MongoDB.
8. Display the posts in a group on the group page for all group members to see.
9. Allow users to leave a group if they no longer want to be a member.
10. Ensure that only members of a group can post in the group, and that non-members cannot view the group posts.*/
